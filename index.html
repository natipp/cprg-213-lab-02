        <h3><u>The Story Behind the Recipe</u></h3>

        <p>
            The Octopus Burger is an original recipe created by Pioneer Square D&E, a
            neighborhood bistro located in the heart of Seattle. Best of all,
            everything is made from scratch. Originally founded by seattle born
            husband and wife Jonathan Flemming and Libby Aker. The well-loved local
            bistro is fairly new, and opened back in Fall of 2018, an quickly rose to
            popularity. Unfotunatly, similar to many other local small business - D&E
            took a slight hit duing the COVID-19 pandemic and had to limit their
            services. Now however, they are completely open, well recovered, and
            better than ever.
